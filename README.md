# NikkeAutoScript
A python script that uses image recognition to automate actions on the game Nikke: Goddess of Victory


You need python with open-cv and tkinter to run this project


!!! You might need to change yourself value for arena mode and special arena mode to select an opposant and for click to confirm button you can easily change the coordinate in detection.py, those are the only button that doesn't use image recognition.

I think this type of script is safe because its only simulate tapping on screen and didn't inject anything so it should be ok, but i don't claim any responsability of what you do with this, how you use it and i take no responsibility in case of ban.

You need to have your windows with the game open on your main screen to make this work. Update are programmed to fix somes possible issues. It can work with emulator.
